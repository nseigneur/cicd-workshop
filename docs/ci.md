## 1 - Implement Continuous Integration (CI)

### 1.1 - Use a starter workflow

To build a workflow that employs Actions for your Continuous Integration process, start by adding a **starter workflow** to your repository:

1. From your repository's main view, find and navigate to the **Actions** tab.
2. Select **New workflow**.
3. Search for `push`.
4. Click **Configure** under the `push` starter workflow.

To finish setting up your initial CI workflow, commit the `push.yml` file to the `main` branch.

<details>
<summary>Your `.github/workflows/push.yml` should contain the following:</summary>

```yml
name: Build and Push

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

          labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
          cache-from: type=gha
          cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

### 1.3 - Understanding references to actions

As you can see, we're employing a workflow, `actions/setup-node`, which is used to install a specific Node.js version on the runner.

Let's dissect the reference to that action to understand its structure:

- `actions/` references the owner of the action, which is translated into a user or organization on GitHub.
- `setup-node` refers to the name of the action, which corresponds to a repository on GitHub.
- `@v3` represents the version of the action, which corresponds to a Git tag or a general reference (such as a branch or even a commit SHA) on the repository.

This reference structure makes it straightforward to navigate to the source code of any action by merely appending the `owner` and `name` to the `github.com` URL, like so: `https://github.com/{owner}/{name}`. For the above example, this would be <https://github.com/actions/setup-node>.

### 1.4 - Understanding Docker push

As in the previous action, we're first using the checkout action, afterward we're using the `docker/setup-buildx-action` to set up the Docker Buildx builder. This is required to build multi-architecture images which we intend to build to support Mac and Windows users. 
We must login to the Github Docker Registry by leveraging built-in variables and secrets. We prepare the Docker Image MetaData by using the `docker/metadata-action` and finally build and push the Docker Image using the `docker/build-push-action`.

We can see the multi-plaform build configuration `platforms: linux/amd64, linux/arm64`.


### Checking workflow runs

Your newly implemented CI workflow now runs with every push. Given that you just pushed a new commit containing the workflow you've created, you should already have a workflow run in progress.

Keep in mind that we will need to run tests as part of our CI workflow. You can find most of this application's tests in the [`src/pages/Home.test.tsx`](../src/pages/Home.test.tsx) file, which partly looks like this:

```typescript
// ... imports

describe("<Home />", (): void => {
  afterEach((): void => {
    cleanup();
  });

  it("renders the octocats returned from the API.", async (): Promise<void> => {
    const inMemoryAPI = createInMemoryOctocatApi();
    inMemoryAPI.addOctocats([
      createTestOctocat({ id: "#1", name: "Octocat 1" }),
      createTestOctocat({ id: "#2", name: "Octocat 2" }),
    ]);

    renderWithProviders({ component: <Home />, inMemoryApi: inMemoryAPI });

    expect(await screen.findByText("Octocat 1")).toBeDefined();
    expect(screen.getByText("Octocat 2")).toBeDefined();
  });

  // ... more tests

});

```

The result of your last push to the main branch should resemble the following:
